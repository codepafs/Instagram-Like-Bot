A simple Instagram like bot that likes posts based on the hashtags you provide. Helps with getting back likes and gaining followers who share the same interests as you.

I've chosen to go with a minimalistic UI.

### Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in your shell.


### Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyQt5, for building/editing the UI ``` sudo apt-get install qt5-default ```
- [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy), for devloping the GUI.
- Selenium, for web automation.
- webdriverdownloader, for downloading geckodriver for Firefox. You're free to use any browser, but you'll have to make the appropriate changes in `main.py`.

### Usage
1. Run ```main.py```.
2. The UI will open up. Enter all the inputs. Rest assured, your password is safe.
3. Click on the 'Submit' button and wait a few seconds.
4. Sit back and watch how the bot goes.
